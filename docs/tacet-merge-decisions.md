# Tacet shared-core merge — decisions record, v0.4

**2026-07-31 · A living record of what has been decided so far for the Tacet shared-core merge, so the decisions stop living in chat. Supersedes v0.1. The open questions in §20 are NOT decided and must not be treated as settled.**

---

## 0. Governing rules — these override everything below

These three rules govern every decision in this document and every decision made after it. Where anything in this document conflicts with them, these rules win and the conflicting decision is wrong.

1. FULL CIRCLE NO LONGER EXISTS. The name is retired completely. The system is Tacet. Any remaining Full Circle naming in code, documentation, UI or configuration is a defect to be removed.

2. TACET IS NOT BUILT FOR ROOTS. Roots is one customer that happens to be first. Nothing about Roots' business — its products, its city, its language, its currency, its sales channels, its suppliers, its way of working — may be assumed, hardcoded or treated as the default.

3. TACET IS A MULTI-BUSINESS PRODUCT. Businesses of any kind, in any country, must be able to register and use it. Every feature, every setting and every proposal must be evaluated against a business that is nothing like Roots.

### Consequences already identified
These follow directly from the rules above and correct earlier decisions in this document:
- SALES CHANNELS ARE NOT A FIXED LIST. The channel list recorded earlier (WeChat, Web, POS, Meituan, Eleme, GZ Grocery, Manual) is Roots' channel list, not Tacet's. Channels must be configured per business, with integrations offered as available options. GZ Grocery in particular is specific to one customer.
- CURRENCY IS PER BUSINESS. The codebase currently hardcodes CNY and the ¥ symbol in hundreds of places. This is a defect.
- UNITS OF MEASURE ARE PER BUSINESS. Grams and kilograms may not be assumed. A business using pounds and ounces must be equally well served.
- LANGUAGE IS PER BUSINESS. English-plus-Chinese may not be assumed or required. A single-language business must not be forced to supply two names for everything, and a business using two other languages must be supported.
- Already consistent with these rules, recorded for clarity: the business time zone is a per-business setting derived from the signup address, and the hardcoded category seed tree is being deleted rather than kept as a default.

### Standing test
Before any design decision is accepted, it must be checked against a business unlike Roots — for example a hardware shop in Ohio, or a bakery in Lisbon. If the decision only makes sense for a vegan food business in Guangzhou, it is wrong.

## 1. Architecture target

- One backend, one database. VERIFIED ALREADY TRUE — single Express process, single SQLite file (database.js:8). The split was never at the database; it is at the table level.
- Two frontends for now: Store and Kitchen. Each frontend is the only app-specific layer.
- Every core entity exists exactly once. No duplicated tables, no sync jobs.
- The end state is a single application with one interface. Every decision here is made to make that merge cheap.

## 2. Permissions

- Permissions are per-capability, not per-frontend. A user holds capabilities; each frontend shows what that user's capabilities allow.
- Reason: a per-frontend model would have to be unpicked when the two apps merge into one interface. Capabilities survive the merge unchanged.

## 3. Items and products — CORRECTED, supersedes v0.1 §3

v0.1 stated one table with a SELLABLE switch. WITHDRAWN. The correct model:

- TWO separate lists. ITEMS and PRODUCTS are different entities with different tables and separate stock.
- ITEMS: kitchen only. Raw materials and anything produced for use in further production. Never sold. Never visible to the store app.
- PRODUCTS: sold to customers. Visible in both apps.
- There is NO sellable switch and no shared table.
- The bridge between the two is a RECIPE. Packing is production: bulk item in, product out.
- Worked example the model must support exactly as described: buy cashews (item) → produce cream (item) → produce cheese (product, from cream) AND pack cream into jars (product, from cream). The kitchen's bulk cream and the store's jarred cream are genuinely different things with separate stock. This is intended, not duplication.
- Confirmed: the store never sells directly from a kitchen container. Everything sold is packed first.

## 4. Product fields

Applies to the PRODUCT record only; items are kitchen-only and need no such split.

- Every field on the merged record is classified into exactly one of three groups: KITCHEN, STORE, or BOTH.
- KITCHEN = production, recipes, costing. STORE = selling and presentation. BOTH = shared, e.g. nutritional facts.
- Shared (BOTH) fields are editable from BOTH apps. There is no single owning side. DECIDED — do not reintroduce field ownership.
- The classification itself is pending the tacet-product-fields.md inventory.

## 5. Concurrent edit safety

Because shared fields are editable from both apps, the merged product record must carry:

- A version stamp. On save, the server verifies the row has not changed since the client loaded it. On mismatch, reject the save and return a plain-English message telling the user the record was changed by someone else and to reload. Never silently overwrite.
- `updated_by` and `updated_at`, surfaced in the UI next to shared fields so a user can see who last touched them and when.

This supersedes the alternative of assigning an owning side per shared field, and closes risk R11 from tacet-core-survey.md.

## 6. Production

- Multi-level, any depth. Real-world depth today is three levels.
- A recipe may produce an item or a product.
- Cost rolls up through levels.
- A production batch records ACTUAL quantities used, not recipe quantities.
- Confirming a batch is what moves stock: inputs out, output in. Nothing moves before confirmation.

## 7. Locations

- Locations is a Tacet CORE module, shared by both apps. Not owned by either.
- Who can do what is decided by capability, not by which app the user is in.
- Two kinds: PHYSICAL and TEMPORARY. This is about permanence only.
- KITCHEN is a FLAG, not a kind. Any location may also be flagged as a kitchen. CONFIRMED.
- WAREHOUSE is not a kind. A warehouse is a physical location with no sales channel attached.
- Sales channels may be attached to any location, including one flagged as a kitchen.
- TEMPORARY locations: can be closed, can NEVER be deleted. Closing requires remaining stock to be moved to a named location and confirmed by a user.
- PHYSICAL locations: can be closed and continue to hold and manage stock.
- Replaces `markets`, `retail_stores`, and the plain-text warehouse/store names on purchase and restock orders.

## 8. Stock

- ONE stock record per thing per location. Nothing else. Totals are computed by summing, never stored.
- ONE movement ledger. Every stock change writes to it.
- The store's existing model is ADOPTED as the core: physical quantity, safety buffer, per-channel caps, reservations, ledger. Do not design a replacement.
- RETIRED: `products.stock_qty` and `market_stock`. `market_stock` has not been maintained by any real process; its numbers are untrustworthy and MUST NOT be migrated. Kitchen and market locations require a physical count at cutover.
- PHYSICAL and AVAILABLE are different numbers. Every screen must state which one it shows.
- The safety buffer holds stock back from sale. Set by whoever runs production. The shop can only sell what is above the buffer.

## 9. Users

- ONE list of people. ONE login.
- What a user can see and do comes from capabilities, not from which account or app.
- Migration: the two existing user lists both number from 1, so ids collide. Ids must be reassigned and every historical reference repointed. Flagged as careful, high-risk work.
- Fixes the existing gap where the activity log cannot record a store-side actor.

## 10. Purchasing

- ONE purchasing flow for the whole business. Same screen, same suppliers, same orders.
- An order line is simply: a thing, a quantity, a delivery location.
- Users see only what their capabilities and locations allow.

## 11. Sales record

- ONE sales record for the whole business. Every sale from every channel, written once, one shape.
- The kitchen's separate sales log is RETIRED, not merged. Confirmed: no kitchen-only sales exist.
- POS is REMOVED from the kitchen app and becomes a sales channel like any other. A POS sale creates an order, moves stock, and lands in the sales record.
- Existing spreadsheet importers are repointed at the single record.

## 12. Channels

The agreed list, replacing two divergent sets of names:

- WeChat (mini-program shop) — absorbs the old `miniapp`
- Web (website) — absorbs the old `retail`
- POS — absorbs the old `dinein`
- Meituan
- Eleme
- GZ Grocery
- Manual

Channels are attachable to any location.

## 13. Time and dates

- Tacet is a product for multiple businesses. Nothing is hardcoded to Guangzhou.
- Each business has ONE business time zone, applying to every report and every "today".
- Set automatically from the address given at signup; changeable afterwards in settings.
- Business-wide, NOT per location, even for businesses spanning time zones.
- Displayed timestamps may render in the viewer's local time, always labelled with the zone.
- Business-day boundaries never follow the viewer's device.

## 14. Product state — replaces three overlapping flags

Today a product carries `status` (Active/Inactive/Seasonal/Coming Soon), `is_active` and `is_published`. All three are replaced by ONE state with three positions:

- IN SHOP — visible to customers
- NOT IN SHOP — still in use, not on display
- ARCHIVED — out of use, hidden everywhere automatically, retained in historical orders and reports

Archiving requires no other switch to be set first. Seasonal and Coming Soon are withdrawn as states; if wanted they become customer-facing tags, not states.

## 15. Item state

ONE state with two positions:

- IN USE
- ARCHIVED — removed from recipe pickers and purchase screens, retained in historical batches and orders

## 16. SKU on archive

- An archived product KEEPS its SKU permanently. The code is never released for reuse.
- Reason: a reused code makes historical orders and reports point at the wrong thing.
- This overrides the store side's current behaviour, which nulls the SKU on delete.

## 17. Categories

- TWO separate category systems with no overlap.
- PRODUCTS: keep the existing two-level tree (top category + subcategory). It is what customers navigate.
- ITEMS: their own separate category list, for finding things in the kitchen.
- DELETED: the legacy free-text `category` column on products, and the hardcoded fallback seed tree.
- Reason for separation: customer categories are shop navigation; item categories are a filing system. They would never share vocabulary.

## 18. Deletion policy

- Nothing with history is ever truly deleted. Everything archives.
- Archived things disappear from pickers and lists but remain visible in the historical records that reference them.
- People who leave keep their name on the work they did.
- SINGLE EXCEPTION: a record with no references anywhere may be hard-deleted — a mistake, a typo, a duplicate created minutes ago. The system must check for references before allowing it.
- This replaces today's inconsistent behaviour, where categories and kitchen users are hard-deleted with no reference check.

## 19. Rollout order — PROPOSED, NOT CONFIRMED

Proposed sequence. Each stage ships independently; nothing waits for the whole programme.

1. Locations
2. Users
3. Stock
4. Items and products
5. Production and costing
6. Purchasing
7. Sales, channels, time zone

Reasoning: locations underpin stock; users first so that every later change is correctly attributed. NOT CONFIRMED — pending Ash on business blackout periods and on whether anything is urgent enough to move earlier.

## 20. Open questions — NOT DECIDED

- Final KITCHEN/STORE/BOTH classification of every product field — pending docs/tacet-product-fields.md.
- Whether `low_stock_threshold` and `supplier_paused` are store fields or operational fields the kitchen also needs.
- Rollout order confirmation (see §19).
